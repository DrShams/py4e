1) in gmane.py (line 86) is that neccessary to use
if start is None : start = 0 from previous try/except block we will have already
start = 0 or, if cur.fetchone() returns None, we can put this if statement just
below (78 line) row of code

2) line 155 what if ln line if len(x) == 1 : there will be 0 matches will we start
again with x = re.findall('\nFrom: (\S+@\S+)\n', hdr) ?
I think here we should add additional elif statement if len(x) == 0 : continue
just before line 151

3) when we type curl -0 https://www.py4e.com/data_space/content.sqlite.zip
we've got an errors:
Warning: Binary output can mess up your terminal. Use "--output -" to tell
Warning: curl to output it to your terminal anyway, or consider "--output
Warning: <FILE>" to save to a file.
I've used
1. curl --output content.sqlite.zip https://www.py4e.com/data_space/content.sqlite.zip
2. unzip content.sqlite.zip

4) while finishing execute file gmane.py last message that we have 60422
after trying to retrieve for instance 2 message it blows up and we have
"Did not find From" but the count became 60424 but it should be 60422 that indicates
that it was the last message we interpreted

5) Just one question
in gmodel.py very interesting in the (184 line)
gmane.org why are we skipping that ?

6) line 176 in gmodel.py blowsup with an error
conn_1 = sqlite3.connect('file:content.sqlite?mode=ro', uri=True)#read only
